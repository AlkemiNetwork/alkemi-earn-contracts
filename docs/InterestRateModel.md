## Functions

- [getSupplyRate(address asset, uint256 cash, uint256 borrows)](#getsupplyrate)
- [getBorrowRate(address asset, uint256 cash, uint256 borrows)](#getborrowrate)

### getSupplyRate

Gets the current supply interest rate based on the given asset, total cash and total borrows

```js
function getSupplyRate(address asset, uint256 cash, uint256 borrows) public view
returns(uint256, uint256)
```

**Returns**

Success or failure and the supply interest rate per block scaled by 10e18

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| asset | address | The asset to get the interest rate of | 
| cash | uint256 | The total cash of the asset in the market | 
| borrows | uint256 | The total borrows of the asset in the market | 

### getBorrowRate

Gets the current borrow interest rate based on the given asset, total cash and total borrows

```js
function getBorrowRate(address asset, uint256 cash, uint256 borrows) public view
returns(uint256, uint256)
```

**Returns**

Success or failure and the borrow interest rate per block scaled by 10e18

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
